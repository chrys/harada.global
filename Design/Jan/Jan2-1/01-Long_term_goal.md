# Long-term Goal (Goal Setting Phase)

The **Long-term Goal** (or "Goal Setting" phase) is the heart of the Harada Framework. It is more than just a deadline; it represents a **"state of victory."** In this system, a goal is only considered strong if it serves a purpose beyond technical completion.

## The Four Perspectives of Success 🧭

To create a goal that provides deep motivation, the Harada Method requires you to look at your objective through four distinct quadrants. This prevents burnout by connecting your "data work" to your personal values and your community.

| Perspective            | Focus                              | Example (Website Goal)                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Self / Tangible 🏆      | Physical rewards or status          | Owning a live URL; earning subscription revenue         |
| Self / Intangible 🧠    | Personal growth and internal feelings| Mastering a full-stack framework; feeling like a creator|
| Others / Tangible 🌍    | Measurable impact on others         | Solving a specific data problem for 100 active users    |
| Others / Intangible ❤️ | Emotional impact on others          | Inspiring your peers; being a role model for your family|

## Writing the Goal Statement

A proper Harada goal statement is written in the present tense, as if it has already happened. This "future-back" thinking helps the brain visualize the success as a reality. It must be:

- **Specific:** Exactly what is the website?
- **Measurable:** How many "real users" count as success?
- **Time-bound:** You've set the end of 2026.

**Example:**

> "It is December 2026, and my platform is live with 500 active users who rely on it for daily data insights, providing me with the pride of a successful launch."

To make your goal truly "Harada-style," we need to find the purpose behind the website. Of the four perspectives in the table above, which one do you think would provide you with the most motivation when you encounter a difficult technical hurdle or a long night of debugging?
