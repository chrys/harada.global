# 64-Task Brainstorming Guide 🧠

## 1. Start with the "8 Pillars" 🏛️

Before diving into the 64 tasks, you must have the **8 Pillars** (sub-goals) identified. These act as the headers for each 8-cell section.

**The Rule:** Each pillar must be a distinct area of focus (e.g., Technical Skills, Marketing, Mental Health, Finance).

## 2. Use the "Action-Oriented" Filter 🛠️

For each pillar, the goal is to identify 8 specific actions. To ensure they are effective, guide the person to ensure every task is:

- **Concrete:** Not "Learn Python," but "Complete the 'Python for Web' module on [Platform]."
- **Measurable:** You should be able to check it off as "Done" or "Not Done."
- **Routine-Friendly:** Some tasks might be one-time (e.g., "Buy a domain name"), while others should be recurring habits (e.g., "Code for 30 minutes every morning").

## 3. The "Categories of Action" Prompt 💡

If the person gets stuck, suggest they look at their pillar through these three lenses:

- **Skill/Knowledge:** What do I need to learn?
- **Physical/Resource:** What do I need to buy, build, or organize?
- **Social/Support:** Who do I need to talk to, email, or follow?

## 4. Facilitation Steps

- **Focus on One Pillar at a Time:** Don't try to fill the whole grid at once. Spend 10 minutes purely on the "Technical" pillar.
- **Quantity First:** Encourage them to write down more than 8 ideas per pillar, then select the "Best 8" that provide the highest leverage.
- **Check for Balance:** Ensure the 64 tasks aren't all "Technical." Remind them that the Harada Method emphasizes the human element—tasks for physical health and mental discipline are just as important for long-term success.
